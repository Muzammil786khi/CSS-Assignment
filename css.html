        <u><h2>POLLUTION</h2></u>
        <p>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.</p>

        <h3>WATER POLLUTION</h3>
